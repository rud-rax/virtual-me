2. build a prototype virtual bot with default settings and attach resume of person as knowledge base

3. (optional) design a software architecture for backend 


# Backend Development Phase

1. develop the backend of application in python to interact with the virtual bot (based on software architecture)

2. (optional) design a software architecture for frontend


# Research Phase (API)

1. try out different APIs (like claude , bard , etc) for the backend application

2. develop the backend based on the API being used


# Research Phase (Virtual Bot)

1. try to use different prompting techniques to get better replies from the virtual bot

2. use different model parameters (temperature , max_length , top p ,etc )to get the desired answer for questions
